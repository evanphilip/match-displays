# Match Displays

Match color and brightness of two display monitors using your phone camera.

## Why?

I am not an artist, but the different tints on my two monitors were nagging me. I did not want to create color profiles, I just wanted to get the monitors to display similar colors using the hardware adjustment on the montor itself. I thought a modern phone camera might be more accurate than eyeballing it.

I used a second-generation iPhone SE with Reincubate Camo. The result was much better than anything I could manage without it.

## Usage

This is a simple script that displays the RGB values of two spots in a video stream. After setting up a video stream (this has to be done separately), the display monitors and camera can be arranged such that the two spots fall on points on the two displays that are supposed to be identical. Now the displays can be adjusted using their hardware controls.
